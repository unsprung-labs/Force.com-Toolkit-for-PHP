Force.com Toolkit for PHP
=========================

EDIT
----

This fork is intended to make the Force.com Toolkit for PHP in packagist and will be used in my personal project to its classes and facilities available to be used in a Laravel 4 port.

The changes made by me (Davis Peixoto) are minor and won't change the core classes functionality, just make it available to be loaded by [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

Once the main project by [developerforce](https://gitub.com/developerforce/) is available though composer, this fork can be dropped and replaced by the original.

Force.com Toolkit for PHP
=========================

The Force.com PHP Toolkit provides an easy-to-use wrapper for the Force.com Web Services SOAP API, presenting SOAP client implementations for both the enterprise and partner WSDLs.

See the [getting started guide](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_Toolkit_for_PHP) for sample code to create, retrieve, update and delete records in the Force.com database.
